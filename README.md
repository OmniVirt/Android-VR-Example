## Usage

**OmniVirt VR Player** for Android provides you a really easy way to embed 360° content on your Android application with just few lines of code.

### Get Started

1. **Sign up** for an account at [OmniVirt](https://www.omnivirt.com)
2. **Upload** your VR / 360° photo or video on [OmniVirt](https://www.omnivirt.com/).
3. Keep the **Content ID** assigned to your content for further use.

Now the content is ready. There are two methods that you can use OmniVirt VR Player to play your VR content on your application.

### Method 1: Launch a Fullscreen VR Player

This method lets you play a VR content with just a single line of code !

#### Usage

First, add the following code to `AndroidManifest.xml`.
```xml
<activity android:name="com.omnivirt.vrkit.FullscreenVRPlayerActivity"
    android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize"></activity>
```

To launch a fullscreen player, simply call:
```java
FullscreenVRPlayerActivity.launch(MainActivity.this,
                                  CONTENT_ID, // Replace with your Content ID
                                  true,       // Autoplay
                                  Mode.ON     // Run in Cardboard mode
                                  );
```

And ... done ! That's all !

#### Extra: Earn Money
Would like to earn money from your 360° content? You can create an **Ad Space** on [OmniVirt](www.omnivirt.com) and pass the **Ad Space ID** acquired to the command like shown below to enable ad on the player.

```java
FullscreenVRPlayerActivity.launch(MainActivity.this,
                                  CONTENT_ID, // Replace with your Content ID
                                  true,       // Autoplay
                                  Mode.ON,    // Run in Cardboard mode
                                  ADSPACE_ID  // Replace with your Ad Space ID
                                  );
```

Once you set it up correctly, user will sometime see an ad among the player and that will turn into your revenue !

#### Player Callback

Any change on the player could be detected by implementing `OnVRPlayerInteractionListener` interface inside the **caller Activity**. Here is the example.

```java
public class PlayerActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements OnVRPlayerInteractionListener {

    ...
    
    private void play() {
        FullscreenVRPlayerActivity.launch(MainActivity.this,
                                          24,
                                          true,       // Autoplay
                                          Mode.ON     // Run in Cardboard mode
                                          );
    }

    /**

### Method 2: Embed a VR Player on an Activity with `VRPlayerFragment`
 
OmniVirt VR Player also provides you a Fragment that allows you to embed a VR Player on your Activity.

#### Usage
 
Add this `fragment` tag to your activity layout xml file.
```xml
<fragment
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:name="com.omnivirt.vrkit.VRPlayerFragment"
    android:id="@+id/vrplayer_fragment" />
```

To start playing, add the following snippet to your activity and replace `CONTENT_ID` with your VR Content's.
```java
VRPlayerFragment player = (VRPlayerFragment) getFragmentManager()
    .findFragmentById(R.id.vrplayer_fragment);
player.load(CONTENT_ID);
player.setCardboard(Mode.OFF);
```
 
Player callback could also be retrieved by the same approach as sample above.

#### Support Library v4 Fragment

Support Library v4 Fragment is also available in `com.omnivirt.vrkit.VRPlayerSupportFragment` class. Usage is still be the same as stock Fragment one.

```xml
<fragment
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:name="com.omnivirt.vrkit.VRPlayerSupportFragment"
    android:id="@+id/vrplayer_fragment" />
```


## QR Code for Cardboard Alignment
 
To launch QR Code scanner to scan a QR Code comes along with the Cardboard, call this following function.
```java
// Stock Fragment
QRReaderFragment.launchCardboardQRScanner(MainActivity.this);

// Support Fragment v4
QRReaderSupportFragment.launchCardboardQRScanner(MainActivity.this);
```
